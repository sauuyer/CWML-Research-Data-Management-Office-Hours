# Cushing/Whitney Medical Library Research Data Whiteboard
#### A Q&A platform offered through the library's Research Data Services

Below you can find a digital whiteboard where you can ask questions about research data management, or research data in general. This website supports RDM Office Hours provided through Yale's Cushing/Whitney Medical Library's (CWML) Data Services. 

This board will be most active during the library's Research Data Office Hours sessions. During November, these sessions take place on Fridays from 1 to 2 pm. To engage in these office hours IRL, visit room E29 in the Medical Library during this time.
